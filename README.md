# Dilated Squeeze-and-Excitation U-net (DSEU)
An end-to-end convolutional network an for image dehazing. Our proposed U-Net based architecture employs Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks at the skip connections to enforce channel-wise attention and parallelized dilated convolution blocks at the bottleneck to 
capture both local and global context, resulting in a richer representation of the image features.
